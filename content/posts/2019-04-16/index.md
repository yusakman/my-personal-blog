Okay, where do we start?

I've told you that this blog is going to be my journey of becoming a blockchain developer and get a job at a company with that status.

To become a blockchain developer, I need to have some skills, especially programming skills.

Well, at this time of writing, I already learned some basics, I spent around three months to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript. And, I end up with this idea, creating a blog website using React (which I don't really know well - **just do it**).

Learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript are not enough. Now, I consider myself to go deeper into Solidity. I've tried a couple times learning Solidity, but I end up with confusion and desperation. That's why I need to evaluate myself, and think, I should probably have other skills before learning Solidity.

For that reason, I'll cover some basic knowledge before I go deeper into Solidity.

I learn from [Freecodecamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/), which is very easy for a complete beginner like me. They have a complete resource for you to practice.

Remember,

> Practice makes perfect

 You can learn :

 - Responsive web design (already covered HTML  and CSS)
 - Javascript algorithms and data structure

Go for the certification.

That's what I'm currently doing as well. As I'm finishing my learning in Freecodecamp, I learn to create this blog, and also learn Solidity.

**FYI**: I also work 40 hours per week in a startup company. Sadly, not as a developer, just an ordinary worker who deals with data.

It could be intimidating, working and learning. I need a crazy amount of motivation every day to be able to complete the day.

That's why, **I won't give up**.

If you are reading this right now. I wanna say thank you. Don't be hestitate to contact me. ;)
