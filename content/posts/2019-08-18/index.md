In this post, I'm going to list websites I've been using to learn how to become a blockchain developer. By the way, the websites I listed here mostly on Ethereum blockchain. Maybe some of you have no idea what Ethereum is, I'll also give you resource if you are interested to know more about it.

Most websites I listed here are free, but they also have premium content where you should pay of course. And, I don't list them based on how good they are. You know, it's just my opinion which should go first and last.

Without going further, these are a list of websites to learn how to become a blockchain developer:

[**1. Ethereum Resources**](http://ethereum.org/developers/)

If you know nothing about Ethereum, [this is](http://ethereum.org/developers/) the right place to start with. Well, if you know a little about Ethereum and want to go deeper, [this is](http://ethereum.org/learn/) for you. If you already know about Ethereum and want to know about the development, you can check [this out.](http://ethereum.org/developers/)

[**2. Mastering Ethereum**](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook)

This should be your guide in learning about Ethereum blockchain development. This could be the starting point if want to deepen your understanding about programing on Ethereum blockchain. You can read it for free on GitHub, but if you prefer convenience you can buy it on Amazon.

[**3. Dapp University**](https://www.dappuniversity.com/)

If you're an active learner and prefer visual, like tutorial video, this is absolutely for you. Not only that, Dapp University has many tutorials on real-world application project. You can check out the youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY0xL8V6NzzFcwzHCgB8orQ). I will recommend you to check it out. If you see my Instagram, I learned from Dapp University a lot.

[**4. CryptoZombies**](https://cryptozombies.io/en/course)

Well, if you can't wait to code in Solidity, this place is for you. It teaches you about Solidity. You'll learn how to create a game on the blockchain. That's awesome right! If you feel overwhelmed when doing this tutorial, then you probably have to take a step back and learn to program to get the most out of it. Be honest, I tried cryptozombies when I only know little about programming. I think I got into trouble in the next chapter. Good news, cryptozombies will tell you the requirement you need ;). This absolute must try tutorial if you want to know more Ethereum.

[**5. Chainshot**](https://www.chainshot.com/)

"Learn to code blockchain technology". Chainshot is also an awesome place to learn how to code or program on the blockchain. It has a beautiful interface, easy to understand, and awesome debugging feature. Chainshot also has a live remote classroom which is an interactive experience for learning blockchain.

[**6. EatTheBlocks**](https://eattheblocks.com/)

This is also a good place to learn how to become a blockchain developer. It has many awesome tutorials. But, this comes with Pro and Free version. If you want to have access to all of the tutorials you have to become a pro member. I think the free version has valuable information and tutorial for us to learn.

**Conclusion**

I hope this post helps you to find the best place for you to learn how to become a blockchain developer. If you want to contact me, just hit me up on Instagram or Twitter. Thanks for reading this.
