Okay, I've just landed at day 100. I want to share what have I learned from coding for 100 days. Before doing that, I want to explain a little bit about #100DaysOfCode and what I'm doing right now.

You can read the official here, [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

100DaysOfCode, in its core, is coding for 100 days. Its two main rules are coding for 1 hour for the next 100 days and tweet your progress every day with #100DaysOfCode. That's it.

But, I changed the rules to fit my situation. I respect all the people that created and already done this challenge. I know it's okay to change the rules as long as you have a good reason for that. Why I changed it? Well, I have different goals for doing this challenge.

First, my goal is I want to see how many days I've coded until I landed on the job, as a blockchain developer. Second, I've spent many days just watching and doing tutorials without coding my own code.

Get back to my first goal, I want to see how many days I've coded until I landed on the job as a blockchain developer. This is my ultimate rule. Because of that, I won't stop at day 100 and will keep continuing my journey to 101, 102, etc until I get the job.

Since you already know what I'm currently doing, let me share the lessons I've learned from coding for 100 days.

**1. Courage To Learn In Public**

Well, I was like, "should I do this?" before it all started. I was afraid people will judge me. What would my friends think about me? Some of them already settled with a good job, and here's me, just started learning something new.

Be honest, if I've never tried to post, I won't be here today writing my first post. Courage was not something I had when I first started. I develop it as I keep on posting. Post after post, my courage was increasing, I'm bolder now. I don't care what other people think anymore. Now I have the courage to learn in public.

My future boss will look up into my learning process and realize that he/she should hire a guy like me. :D

**2. Ability To Be Consistent**

Consistent is something you'll have as you pushing toward your goals. That's pretty much the case when I'm doing 100 days coding challenge. As I keep pushing toward my goals, consistency becomes natural to me.

Oh, by the way, consistency is about behaving similar way. What's important is, it builds momentum, it forms habits that become our second nature.

**3. **Grit****

What if doing well in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily?

I think I should bring [Angela Lee from TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H14bBuluwB8) if I want to talk about Grit.

She found out that one character that can be a significant predictor of success was grit. It wasn't social intelligence, it wasn't a good look, physical health, and it wasn't IQ. It was grit.

Grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals.

Grit is having stamina.

Grit is sticking with your future, day in day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years. And working really hard to make that future a reality.

Grit is living life like is a marathon, not a sprint.

Well, grit is powerful. The problem is, grit is still something that many people don't know about. Though having it would be critical for our success. And I believe, this coding challenge teaches us to have grit.

**Conclusion**

Actually, it's not a conclusion. I just want to emphasis on the last one, grit. Since grit is the most important factor, hopefully, all of us will have it.
